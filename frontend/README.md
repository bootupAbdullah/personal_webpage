I've encountered difficulties in getting two components to behave correctly when applying flex properties via the app.css to the body. The desired layout adjustments weren't achieved, suggesting that both components might need a common parent container for better control.

Although the body tag serves as an existing container, directly styling it in app.css hasn't produced the expected results, particularly in terms of flex spacing between the home and nav components.

To address this, I'm considering introducing a main div as a parent for these components. Initial tests suggest that this setup allows for more precise control over component widths and layout adjustments. I plan to implement and test further CSS modifications to confirm if this approach resolves the issues.
