      <p>I'm a software engineer who transitioned from accounting to build meaningful, user-centered applications. After years in finance, I discovered my passion for creating tools that solve real problems.</p>
      
      <p>I completed General Assembly's intensive software engineering program, building full-stack applications with React, Node.js, Python, and Django. My projects include a Marvel API integration with authentication, an interview sharing platform, and a movie recommendation app â€” deployed using Netlify and Railway.</p>
      
      <p>Currently, I'm contributing to open-source projects through the ProgramEarth DevSecOps Fellowship, expanding my skills in cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. My accounting background brings discipline and attention to detail to my development work.</p>
      
      <p>I'm seeking my first software development role where I can contribute technical skills, collaborate with mission-aligned teams, and continue building applications that serve people well.</p>
