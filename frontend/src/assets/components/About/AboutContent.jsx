      <p>I'm a software engineer who discovered programming while working in tax preparation. What started as evening and weekend learning became a passion I couldn't ignore.</p>
      
      <p>After nearly two years of self-study, I took a leap and completed General Assembly's intensive software engineering program. I built full-stack applications exploring everything from API integrations to user authentication, always focused on solving real problems.</p>
      
      <p>Currently, I'm contributing to open-source projects through the ProgramEarth DevSecOps Fellowship while continuing to learn and build. My accounting background taught me discipline and attention to detail - qualities that serve me well in development.</p>
      
      <p>I'm ready for my first software development role where I can contribute, collaborate, and keep growing as a developer.</p>
