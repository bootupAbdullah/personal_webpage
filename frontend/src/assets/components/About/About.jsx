      <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Abdullah â€” a self-taught software developer with a background in accounting and a deep interest in building tools that are thoughtful, reliable, and grounded in real-world impact.</p>
      <p>After several years in finance, I transitioned into tech and have been gaining hands-on experience, particularly in nonprofit spaces. I'm now looking for my first software development role.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve found myself especially drawn to working with APIs. One of my favorite projects integrated the Marvel API into a full MERN stack application. It challenged me to navigate authentication, manage asynchronous data flows, and design a responsive UI with real-time feedback.</p>
      <p>Right now, Iâ€™m focused on growing as a developer, contributing to mission-aligned teams, and writing code that serves people well.</p>
